# Predictive Framework: How to Catch Future Themes

*Derived from analysis of 6 theme waves (2018-2025)*

---

## The Core Question

We know WHAT worked (85% drawdown + low volume). But HOW do we catch the next theme before it pumps?

---

## Pattern 1: Theme Ignition Speed

Some themes ignite all at once, others build slowly:

| Wave | Stocks | Spread | Type |
|------|--------|--------|------|
| Crypto W1 (Mar 2020) | 8 | **16 days** | Flash ignition |
| Crypto W2 (Dec 2022) | 5 | **13 days** | Flash ignition |
| Space W1 (Dec 2022) | 5 | **19 days** | Flash ignition |
| Nuclear W2 (2024) | 3 | 229 days | Slow build |
| Space W2 (2024) | 5 | 265 days | Slow build |
| CleanEnergy W1 | 6 | 445 days | Slow build |
| Nuclear W1 | 6 | 448 days | Slow build |

### Implication

- **Flash themes (Crypto, Space W1):** Must catch the first mover, then immediately check all related stocks
- **Slow themes (Nuclear, CleanEnergy):** Time to research and build positions over months

---

## Pattern 2: Pre-Ignition Setup

What did stocks look like AT THE MOMENT of ignition?

| Theme | Avg Drawdown | Avg Days Declining | Avg Vol Ratio |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Crypto | -90% | 361 days | 6.42x (high!) |
| Meme | -87% | 427 days | 1.22x |
| Space | -79% | 430 days | 1.72x |
| Nuclear | -75% | 314 days | 1.11x (low) |
| CleanEnergy | -70% | 282 days | 1.41x |

### Implication

- Themes ignite when stocks are **70-90% down** and have been **declining 9-14 months**
- Volume varies: Crypto had HIGH volume at ignition, Nuclear had LOW volume
- **Look for sectors where multiple stocks hit these thresholds simultaneously**

---

## Pattern 3: External Catalysts

Every major wave had an identifiable trigger:

| Wave | Trigger | Lead Time |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Dec 2018 | Fed pivot signal | Immediate |
| Mar 2020 | COVID crash bottom | Immediate |
| Jan 2021 | Stimulus checks + Reddit | 1-2 weeks buildup |
| Dec 2022 | FTX collapse = crypto capitulation | Immediate |
| 2024 | AI power demand narrative | Months of buildup |

### Catalyst Types

1. **Market crash** → Everything ignites at once (Mar 2020)
2. **Sector capitulation** → Specific theme ignites (FTX → Crypto W2)
3. **Narrative shift** → Slow build (AI power → Nuclear/Space 2024)

---

## Pattern 4: Leading Indicators

### What to Monitor

| Indicator | What It Signals | Example |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| VIX spike > 30 | Market fear = ignition coming | Mar 2020, Dec 2022 |
| Sector ETF hits 52-week low | Theme may be bottoming | XLE (energy), ARKK |
| High-profile bankruptcy | Capitulation signal | FTX, Lehman |
| New narrative in headlines | Slow-build theme forming | "AI needs power" (2024) |
| First mover +50% in a week | Flash theme starting | Watch all related tickers |

### Sector ETFs to Watch

| Theme | ETF to Monitor |
|-------|----------------|
| Crypto | BITO, COIN stock |
| Clean Energy | ICLN, TAN, QCLN |
| Nuclear | URA, NLR |
| Space | ARKX, UFO |
| Biotech | XBI, IBB |
| Small Cap Tech | ARKK, IWM |

---

## Pattern 5: The "First Mover" Signal

When a theme is about to ignite:

1. **One stock breaks out** (50%+ in 1-2 weeks)
2. **Check all related stocks** - are they at similar setups (85% down, low volume)?
3. **If yes** → Theme wave likely starting
4. **Buy the laggards** that haven't moved yet

### Example: Crypto W2 (Dec 2022)

```
Dec 16: ARBK starts moving
Dec 27: CIFR, IREN, COIN ignite
Dec 28: EBON follows

If you caught ARBK, you had 11 days to position in the others.
```

## Predictive Checklist

### Market-Level Signals

- [ ] VIX recently spiked above 30?
- [ ] Major index down 15%+ from high?
- [ ] Sector ETF at 52-week low?
- [ ] High-profile bankruptcy/scandal in sector?

### Stock-Level Signals

- [ ] Multiple stocks in same sector down 80%+?
- [ ] Declining 9-14 months?
- [ ] Volume ratio < 1.0 (exhaustion)?
- [ ] First mover showing unusual volume?

### Narrative Signals

- [ ] New "big story" emerging in headlines?
- [ ] Government policy shift? (green energy, AI, defense)
- [ ] Technological breakthrough announced?

---

## The Playbook

### Step 1: Identify Candidate Themes

Monitor sectors where:
- Multiple stocks are 70-90% off highs
- Declined for 9+ months
- Sector ETF at or near 52-week low

### Step 2: Wait for Trigger

- Market crash (VIX > 30)
- Sector capitulation event
- First mover breakout

### Step 3: Act Fast on Flash Themes

When first mover breaks out:
- Immediately screen all related tickers
- Buy those matching the setup (85% down, low volume)
- You have ~2 weeks before the wave completes

### Step 4: Build Slowly on Narrative Themes

When new narrative emerges:
- Identify all related stocks
- Build positions over 3-6 months
- These themes take 1-2 years to peak

---

## Current Watchlist Framework

### How to Build It

1. **Screen for beaten-down sectors** (use sector ETFs at 52-week lows)
2. **Identify stocks 80%+ down** within those sectors
3. **Group by theme** (manually or by industry)
4. **Monitor for first mover** (50%+ in 2 weeks)
5. **Alert on volume spike** (2x+ average)

### What to Track

| Field | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Ticker | ID |
| Theme | Grouping |
| Drawdown | Must be 80%+ |
| Days declining | Sweet spot 270-450 |
| Volume ratio | < 1.0 ideal |
| Days since last check | Freshness |
| First mover in theme? | Trigger signal |

---

## Limitations

1. **We can't predict narratives** - AI power demand wasn't obvious until it was
2. **Black swans are unpredictable** - COVID crash couldn't be anticipated
3. **Not all beaten-down stocks recover** - Many go to zero
4. **Theme classification is subjective** - Hard to automate

---

## Next Steps to Operationalize

| Task | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Build sector ETF monitor | Catch sector lows |
| Create theme watchlists | Group related stocks |
| Add first-mover alerts | Catch flash ignitions |
| Track narrative news | Catch slow-build themes |
| Backtest entry signals | Validate volume spike trigger |
